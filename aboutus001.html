                        <p>Dr. T. Momanyi conceived this transformational idea of facilitated education and support programs as the most befitting input of boosted learning in the marginalized communities. This is partly due to affordability costs, and partly poor utilities. He sought to reach the somehow sidelined population who are surging with vigor for inclusivity, yet unseen for failure of these frontier programs.     </p>
