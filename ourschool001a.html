    <h3>For Your Absolute Suitability And Expediency</h3>
    <p class="large">
        With the rise of cashless culture, people now prefer to carry cards for various types of transactions instead of using cash. Why? Because it’s easy, hassle free and you no longer have to worry about your money being stolen.
    Using a POS swipe machine is that pretty easy. You swipe the card in the ATM swipe machine, and then enter your PIN and finally your fingerprint. In less than 30 seconds you can see the money deducted from a customer’s account and deposited to the merchant’s account.
